<div class="the_story">
	<p>He was panting, counting each tread of foot upon the ground. He had thought for the longest time that it was too damn cold outside, but now that he was entering into this town again, he was sweating profusely. </p>
	<br>
	<p>He stopped to catch his breath, and muttered beneath it, <q>It’s too damn hot in here.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>He gazed up from the ground, and had to squint his eyes in order to see his surroundings. He had been looking down at the ground ever since he had entered, counting each step and beginning to sweat with the new added warmth. Suddenly he believed his eyes were well enough adjusted to be able look up. He was wrong. All things looked fuzzy, and his eyes felt burned, like the humans do when they look up at the sun. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Soon, he thought, soon he will adjust. He began walking again.</p>
	<br>
	<p>He couldn’t quite remember which house his old friend had lived in, it had been so long, and he was un-astonished by how little things had changed. He burrowed his face downward to the earth again, looking at the swinging pendulum of his feet moving back and forth like the clock works’ in time un-eternal. Sweat began pouring down his face, or at least, he had begun noticing his drenched complexion. </p>
	<br>
	<p>He stopped again, pulling out a white handkerchief, and wiping down his forehead. His long dark suite was firmly placed upon his body, and as he moved even the slightest, he felt the sticky cohesiveness of sweat-drenched skin to foreign cloth.  He felt hopelessly lost in the light. He burrowed onward, each step like a hiker walking up hill in three feet of snow. </p>
	<br>
	<p>He hardly noticed that he was looking no longer at his feet, but at his surroundings when, with shock of surprise, he let out a gasp. He was in a neighborhood now. It was the old neighborhood. He could see four or five houses on each side of him.  He stood looking around at huge, magnificent castles with large fences and guards outside of them. He was alone, out of place in the middle of the urban street. Two guards, dressed in shining armor of gold stood stiff ten yards away from him on both sides, protecting two different houses. </p>
	<br>
	<p>His eyesight was back; he began to snarl into a boisterous laugh. His eyes shot quickly at the guard on his right, and then turned, feeling the sweat stick to the cloth, and stared down the guard on the left. Neither of them moved. They did not even show awareness of his presence. The house on the left was quite exquisite. The guard laid between the middle of two rounded gate doors connected on both sides by twelve feet of, high and full, green forestry. Beyond the gate contained a pathway leading up a hill, and far off into the distance he could see the two tops of one of their castles. He stood staring at the guard, and walked over to him cautiously, making sure to carry with him a magnitude of importance.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Hello guard.</q> He walked right in front of the man.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The guard stood looking still. He smiled, not believing how similar in stature and disposition that these guards looked compared to those silly soldiers in front of the queens castle in England. </p>	
	<br>
	<p>He spoke again, <q>Is this the house of Michael?</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>The guard seemed to stare right through him.  The guard opened his mouth and spoke softly, still keeping statuesque, <q>Go away.</q></p>	
	<br>
	<p>The dark suited man smiled, looking at the guard. He took steps closer, and was now within inches of the guards face. The guard had a handsome face, blonde hair, youthful look, eyes stern. He stood staring at the young boy, as his face grew tighter.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Is this the house of Michael?</q></p>	
	<br>
	<p>The young boy said nothing. </p>
	<br>
	<p><q>I know it is.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>He let go of the stern look, and breathed deeply while running his hands through his greased back black hair. He had finally caught his breath from the long, hot, journey. His energy was returning. A most wicked smile popped up on to the sweaty suited man, and as he looked into the boys blue eyes he realized how much he loved them. He loved them just like he loved oysters, just after they were steamed, ready to be pulled out and eaten.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Listen kid, my old friend lives in this house.</q> He took a step back and placed his hands into his pockets. <q>And I am here to reconnect.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p><q>You’re not supposed to be here.</q> The young guard spoke softly. The young guard began to fidget. The man smiled again, seeing the breaking of a statue.</p>
	<br>
	<p>They stood there looking at each other.  Slowly and steadily the gates began to break apart and the guard took notice. The armored boy stepped to the side and resumed his queen of England protector format, but lowered his sword. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The man breathed deep in, noticing a pinch of excitement, and placed his hands on his suit collar and stepped inside the gate.  It didn’t take him long to get to the front door of his dear old friends palace.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The doors were wooden, and polished with a natural perfection. Nothing was added, but the woodwork was impeccable. The man in the suit could not help but place his hands on the wooden frame doors and slowly move up and down feeling the natural fortune. The whole house, except for the rooftops and towers, were all made from carved wood. It looked like a cabin for an angel, just as it should. He began to laugh again.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The door opened.  It was Michael. </p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Well hello.</q> Michael said, smiling in a polite way.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Hello my old friend.</q> The man stepped in, but no more than a step, for Michael did not move for him to enter entirely.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>How have you been, Abaddon?</q> Michael was in warm white silk.  He stood smiling. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Abaddon stood a foot in the doorway. He wanted to speak, but lost the words. He looked into Michaels face for a form of energy to take. He let out a scream, He howled and nothing shook, like it did on earth. Looking into Michael’s eyes was worse than looking into the sun, it was worse than when he entered this town. He felt woozy. <q>Forgive, me for, I-</q> His right hand's fingers were pressed to his eyes, as he held his head down squinting his face. <q>I need to sit down, it has been a long journey.</q> He could not see, but there was a pause of silence. In that silence he felt something inside his chest pound, and it threw him off balance. He stumbled backward and fell against the ground. It was a heartbeat. The silence was so beautiful, he thought. He cursed the injury. </p>
	<br>
	<p>He heard the voice of Michael. First a sigh, or resignation, and then a reply, <q>alright. Abaddon, come inside, though I am afraid it’s not much cooler.</q></p>
	<br>
	<hr style="border: 2px dotted #FFFFFF;"\>
	<br>
	<p><q>So, how has it been outside, Abaddon?</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>Michael sat in a chair across from him, they were both holding tea in cups; Michael had brewed them. Back outside, Abaddon remembered, he never liked their teas, nothing ever tasted good. In that way, he chuckled to himself, he loved them. He loved them, though not for drinking. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Abaddon took a large gulp from his glass; he liked how it’s off the kettle temperature burned down his throat. <q>Well, my dear old friend, it is quite nice.</q> Abaddon cleared his throat, <q>you see, we are having a grand old time. It’s indeed lovely down on earth.</q> </p>
	<br>
	<p>He took another sip. Michael was looking at him warmly, but silently. Abaddon felt the familiar anger grow within him. He did not want that beautiful silence again. <q>You see - well, how about yourself?</q> He took another sip, <q>do you make it down there much?</q> He hoped Michael would reply fast.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Yes, on occasion-</q> then added <q>though, strictly on business.</q> Michael pulled his glass up and took a sip. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Abaddon, no longer was sweating. In fact, he noticed that he had never felt better in centuries. He took a sip. It was good to be back.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The silence was slipping in again, Abaddon felt his ears ringing, and tried not to show anything but a confident smile. <q>You know Michael, we are getting more and more each day.</q> </p>
	<br>
	<p>Michael, who was still sipping at his tea, relaxingly in his chair, pulled the glass down gently, <q>yes</q>.  <q>Well what is a day to an eternity really.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>Abaddon’s smile grew dark, he felt well again, well again and confident. </p>
	<br>
	<p><q>We are close to a world domination again, the humans now call it westernization. Our father is quite proud.</q> He put his finished glass down, and continued gazing around at the magnificence of the household,  <q>apple has been doing wonders as well, most people are so glued to their screens that they don’t have time to look for true purpose, and beyond that their egos are-</q> He was cut off, when Michael spoke he could do nothing put cease.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Temporal things make distractions, yes. Is this what you came here to speak about?</q></p>
	<br>
	<p><q>We are getting a lot of them now, even those who believe.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>Michael stood up smiling; he walked over and placed a gentle hand upon Abandons shoulder. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Abaddon continued, <q>I mean, do they even realize why there is a bite out of their damn apple on their wretched devises anyway? To be honest, it’s almost too easy.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p> Michael looked at Abaddon, as many mothers had looked onto their kids, with a love that Abaddon despised and couldn’t understand. </p>
	<br>
	<p><q>My dear Abaddon, you withered soul</q> Michael looked sad and concerned, with a helpless glance, like a mother toward a son at his funeral. </p>
	<br>
	<p><q>We’ve clouded minds, and numbed war and killing, and, ah-</q> Michael was walking Abaddon back to the front door. He noticed that he was sweating again, and his eyes were burning. His breath was away from him. He gasped, <q>We will win earth, all of earth.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>At that moment the power of hatred spilled down into Abaddon’s soul cavity, and gave him new strength. He unleashed himself from Michael, and turned his helplessness into fury. </p>
	<br>
	<p><q>We will destroy it all, everything. You and your futile love. You all, and your futile truth, you and your God.</q> His voice flared, <q>you will have worked towards nothing but in vain. We are taking everything.</q> All was turning red.</p>
	<br>
	<p><q>Find one human, just one who is not besieged with some hate. Find one human, who we have not seduced into darkness. Find one human, whose kindness of action and thought has never been compromised with ego and self-sustainment. We have created an earth, which covets fame, prosperity, and recognition! I dare you Michael, from the pits of hell to find one.  Those whose souls outweigh their ego, who sees the truth and have fought for your cause, even all of them, even that small minority, have been time and time again brought under our control and spell. Find me one, who has been untouched. You will not win.</q></p>
	<br>
	<p>The familiar red cloud lifted from Abaddon, as his ripped suit fell back onto his returned transformation to human form.  He was outside the door again. Michael was in the same spot as he had been when he let Abaddon in. Michael looked calm, with a smile of assurance and with a trace of sadness for the listener. <q>You poor withered soul, we have such a man. We have, already won.</q></p>
